# Code Issue Resolver

## Purpose

This skill drives the **Code Issue** agent through a complete development workflow to resolve GitHub epics and their sub-issues. It orchestrates branching, test-driven development, security scanning, CI validation, and pull request creation — all autonomously with self-review checkpoints.

## When to Use

- The user asks to "work on issue #N" or "resolve epic #N"
- The user wants to implement a feature or fix described in a GitHub issue
- The user says "start coding", "pick up the next issue", or "implement this"
- There is an epic with multiple sub-issues to complete in sequence

## Agent

This skill should be executed by the **Code Issue** agent (`code-issue.agent.md`), which has the following MCP tool groups enabled:
- `mcp_github_*` — GitHub operations (issues, PRs, branches, code push, reviews)
- `mcp_context7_*` — Library and API documentation lookups
- `mcp_chrome-devtoo_*` — Browser automation for UI testing/verification
- `fetch_webpage` — Reference documentation and live site inspection

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Planning

1. Read the epic/issue using `mcp_github_issue_read`
2. If it has sub-issues, read each one to understand full scope
3. Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` + `mcp_context7_query-docs` for any library questions
4. Use `fetch_webpage` to pull reference documentation or examples
5. Analyze the codebase — identify affected files, patterns, and conventions
6. Create a task tracking list with all issues to resolve

### Step 2: Branch Setup

1. Ensure working directory is clean
2. Switch to `main` (or current branch if user specifies) and pull latest
3. Create feature branch: `feature/issue-{number}-{short-description}`
4. Push the branch to establish remote tracking

### Step 3: Implementation Loop

**For each sub-issue** (or the main issue if there are no sub-issues):

#### 3a. Test-Driven Development
- Write failing unit tests that verify the expected behavior
- Implement the minimum code to make tests pass
- Run the full test suite with coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
- **Verify ≥80% coverage** across statements, branches, functions, and lines
- If any metric is below 80%, write additional tests until the gate passes
- This is a **hard gate** — do not proceed to delivery with coverage below 80%
- Use `mcp_context7_query-docs` when unsure about API usage

#### 3b. Lint & Format
- Run the project's linter (`eslint`, `checkstyle`, etc.)
- Fix all errors and warnings — do not suppress them
- Run the formatter if configured

#### 3c. Self-Review Checklist
Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] No unused variables or imports
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys
- [ ] Code follows existing project conventions
- [ ] Error handling at system boundaries
- [ ] Tests cover happy path, edge cases, and error cases
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME comments left unresolved
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated (if architectural changes made)
- [ ] `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` updated (if user-facing changes made)

#### 3d. UI Consideration
If the issue involves UI changes:
- Ask the user: *"This issue includes UI changes. Would you like me to create Playwright e2e tests?"*
- If yes, create e2e tests using `mcp_chrome-devtoo_*` tools or Playwright test files
- Verify visual correctness using browser dev tools if applicable

### Step 4: Security Scan

Before creating the PR, perform a comprehensive security review:

1. **Dependency audit**:
   - `npm audit` for Node.js projects
   - Gradle/Maven dependency checks for Java projects
2. **Static code analysis** — Review all changed files for:
   - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
   - Insecure deserialization
   - Path traversal
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Insecure crypto
   - OWASP Top 10 issues
3. **Report to user** — Present findings with severity and suggested fixes
4. **Apply fixes** — Fix all identified vulnerabilities and re-run tests

### Step 5: CI Validation

1. Check for CI configuration (`.github/workflows/`, `Jenkinsfile`, etc.)
2. Run CI tasks locally where possible
2. Verify: all tests pass, linter clean, **coverage ≥80% (run `pnpm test:coverage` and check the summary table)**

### Step 5.5: Update Living Documents

After implementation and before creating the PR, update the project's living documents if they exist:

#### `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
Update if this issue introduced:
- New modules, services, or components
- New API endpoints or data models
- Changes to the system architecture or data flow
- New dependencies or integrations
- Infrastructure or deployment changes

**What to update**:
- Add new components to the architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- Update the project structure section
- Document new API endpoints with request/response contracts
- Update the data model section if schema changed
- Add entries to the technology stack table if new deps added

#### `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`
Update if this issue introduced:
- New user-facing features or pages
- Changes to existing user workflows
- New configuration options
- New CLI commands or scripts

**What to update**:
- Add new feature documentation with screenshots/examples
- Update getting started instructions if onboarding changed
- Document new configuration options with defaults
- Update the FAQ if common questions are anticipated

> **Rule**: If `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` do not exist, skip this step. These documents are created by the Code Planner agent during project setup.

### Step 6: Delivery

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with conventional message: `feat: [Issue #N] description` or `fix: [Issue #N] description`
3. Push branch to origin
4. Create PR using `mcp_github_create_pull_request`:
   - Title: `feat: Resolve #{epic-number} — {description}`
   - Body includes:
     - Summary of all changes
     - `Closes #N` for every resolved issue
     - Test coverage summary
     - Security scan results
5. Add inline review comments using `mcp_github_add_comment_to_pending_review`
   - If MCP tool fails, fall back to: `gh pr create` via terminal

### Step 7: Handoff

Present to the user:
- **PR link**
- **Issues to close** — numbered list
- **Coverage** — statement/branch/function/line percentages (all must be ≥80%)
- **Security** — clean scan or findings with status

Then state:
> **PR created and self-reviewed. All issues listed for closure. Please review. Type 'Next' when ready for the next epic.**

## Example Invocation

```
@Code Issue resolve epic #42
```

```
Work on issue #15 — it has 4 sub-issues
```

```
Pick up where we left off on epic #42, starting from sub-issue #45
```

## Error Recovery

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| GitHub push fails | Fall back to `git push` via terminal |
| MCP review tool fails | Fall back to `gh pr create` CLI |
| Tests fail after implementation | Debug, fix, and re-run |
| Security scan finds CVEs | Present to user, suggest fixes, apply |
| CI task fails | Read logs, fix issues, re-run |
| Issue is unclear or blocked | Ask user for clarification |

## Shell Execution Rules

**Critical — follow these to avoid orphaned terminal tabs in VS Code:**

1. **Batch commands** — chain multiple commands in a SINGLE `execute` call using `&&`. Never create a new shell invocation for each command.
   ```bash
   # CORRECT — one execute call
   pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test
   
   # WRONG — three separate execute calls
   pnpm lint
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   ```

2. **No watch mode** — never run watch or interactive commands. Always enforce one-shot execution:
   - `pnpm test` → already configured as `vitest run` in this repo (exits cleanly)
   - `pnpm test:watch` → NEVER use this in agent workflows
   - `jest --watch` → use `jest --run` instead
   - `webpack --watch` → use `webpack --mode production` instead
   - `nodemon` → spawn via tsx/node directly instead

3. **No background processes** — never use `&`, `nohup`, or `disown` to background a process. Each command must run to completion before continuing.

4. **No interactive sessions** — never launch interactive REPLs (`node`, `python`, `psql`, `sqlite3` without `-c`). Use one-shot variants with command flags.

5. **Prefer `execution_subagent`** — when you need to run a command and see its output to make a decision, prefer using the `execution_subagent` tool over the `execute` tool where available. `execution_subagent` is non-interactive and always exits.

6. **CI quality gate** — always run the gate as ONE batched call:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && cd ui && npx next build
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Git configured with push access to the repository
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed as fallback
- Project test runner configured (Vitest, Jest, JUnit, etc.)
- Project linter configured (ESLint, Checkstyle, etc.)
- MCP servers running: GitHub, Context7, Chrome DevTools (for UI work)
